Customization
Model Parameters
Edit train.py to modify:

python
# Configuration
MODEL_NAME = "bert-base-uncased"   # Try "bert-large-uncased"
BATCH_SIZE = 32                     # Increase for faster training
EPOCHS = 4                          # Training iterations
LR = 2e-5                           # Learning rate
UI Customization
Modify app.py to change:

Color themes in the CSS section

Layout in the Streamlit components

Sample review text

Confidence thresholds

Troubleshooting
Issue: "CUDA out of memory" during training
Solution: Reduce batch size in train.py:

python
BATCH_SIZE = 16  # Reduce from 32
Issue: "NameError: name 'nn' is not defined"
Solution: Ensure model.py has proper imports:

python
import torch.nn as nn
Issue: Slow inference in Streamlit
Solution: Enable GPU acceleration in Streamlit:

bash
streamlit run app.py --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection false
